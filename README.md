### Data Sources:
Housing and Rental value/rate data was gathered from Zillow. Datasets on the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) and Zillow Rent Index (ZRI) were publicly available and downloaded directly from: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

Income, median rent, and population statistics by neighborhood were gathered from city-data.com, which maintains a database of statistics on US cities through both city and private data sources. In the absence of an API/downloadable option, data was scraped from: http://www.city-data.com/nbmaps/neigh-Seattle-Washington.html#N11
